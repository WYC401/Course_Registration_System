# Course Registration System

## About
This is course registration system which can allow students to perform following things:
- register courses
- drop courses already registered
- search courses 
- view all the courses registered

## Who will Use it?
Students with valid username and password can register into this system.

## What is interesting? 
The system is developed by *graph data structure* and I am thinking about adding more functionalities like 
showing students learning roadmapã€‚
